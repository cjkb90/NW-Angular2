# NW-Angular2

Basic app using Angular Express and MongoDB to create salespeople and assign them to regions. 
Creating and validating works with a crude UI, however updating regions for existing salespeople is an enhancement in progress.

Steps: NPM install, open up MongoDB, then NPM start to run on localhost://3000
