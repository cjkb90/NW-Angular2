- good effort
- review the code changes carefully
- I think you still have confusion about how mongo works
- You are calling methods on Model, when you need to call them on instance
- Pass back your objects when looping over them.. I see you used this.salesperson(maybe it worked-- I wouldn't do it--- pass it explicitly)
